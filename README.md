# js-lib-boilerplate

Boilerplate for javascript library written in TypeScript

## Usage

To build and run script in debug or demo purpose, run `npm start`. Webpack dev server serves static files from `resources` directory and built lib script from `/assets/` on port 3000.

Open `http://localhost:3000/sample/index.html` in your browser and you'll see `/resources/sample/index.html`.

You can configure port by modifying webpack.dev.js.

```plain
$ npm start
```

To build TypeScript file(s) and generate JavaScript file for browser use, run `npm run build`. Built js file is created in `/dist/js`.

Library document is generated as well.

Be careful, generated js file and documentation is not version-controled by default!

```plain
$ npm run build
```
